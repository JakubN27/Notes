Some graphs appear so often that they have special names or symbols.

# Bipartite graphs
A graph $K_{p.q}$ is called a complete bipartite graph. Any subgraph of $K{p.q}$ is called a bipartite graph. So a graph is bipartite if and only if we can partition its vertex set to two vertex sets such that every edge has one endpoint in each set.

Simple explanation: A bipartite graph is like a graph split into two parts, and connections only go between the two parts and never between
