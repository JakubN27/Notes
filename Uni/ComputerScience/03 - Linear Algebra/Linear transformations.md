A linear transformation is a function between vector spaces which preserves addition and multiplication. A linear transformation is multiplied using a matrix. A linear transformation will always map the origin in itself, and will not contain a translation.

# Image
The image is the set of all possible outputs of a linear transformation (for any input)

# Kernel
The kernel is the set of all vectors which map to the zero point under a linear transformation. In an injective transformation (one-to-one) this only includes the 0 vector, but in a transformation which is not full rank the kernel will be subspace. This is also known as the nullspace.

## Nullity
The [[Linear Independence#Dimension|dimension]] of the kernel. This corresponds to the number of free variables in the nullspace.
