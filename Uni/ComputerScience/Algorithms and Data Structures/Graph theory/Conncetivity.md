# Paths
A walk in a graph G is a sequence of edges $v_0, v_1, v_2 ... v_{n-1}, v_n$. A path is a walk if all edges are distinct. A path is called a circuit if $v_0 = v_n$.A circuit is called a cycle if all edges are distinct. 

## Newtonian Cycle
A Newtonian Cycle is a cycle where you start and end at the same vertex and hit every edge exactly once.

## Hamiltonian Cycle
A hamiltonian cycle is a cycle where you start and end at the same vertex and hit every vertex once.
