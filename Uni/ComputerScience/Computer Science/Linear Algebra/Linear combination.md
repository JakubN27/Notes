A linear combination of two vectors is a new vector that is constructed by multiplying the two vectors by scalars and adding them.
E.g.:
$$a_1 \vec{v}_1 + a_2 \vec{v}_2 + a_3 \vec{v}_3$$
$$2 \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 2\end{bmatrix} - 1 \begin{bmatrix}3 \\ -1\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}2 \\ 4\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}-3 \\ 1\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}-1 \\ 5\end{bmatrix}
$$
## Span
The span is the set of all possible linear combinations of the vectors. For example, two [[Linear Independence|linearly independent]] vectors' span will form a plane. The span of two linearly independent vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$ will also be the space $\mathbb{R}^2$. The span of two linear vectors will be the line.

## Rank
The rank of a matrix is the dimension of the vector space generated by the span of its columns. This corresponds to the maximal number of linearly independent columns of the matrix.
