A set of vectors is *Linearly Independent* if no vector in the set can be written can be written as a [[Linear combination]] of the other two using vector addition and scalar multiplication.

# Basis
The basis of a vector space is a set of vectors which spans the vector space.
A vector space can have several bases, however all of the bases have the same number of elements, corresponding to the dimension of the vector space. 

## Dimension
The dimension is the number of linearly independent vectors that can exist in a vector space, also described as the cardinality of the basis of the vector space.
More generally,Â dim$(\mathbb {R} ^{n})=n$
The only vector space with dimension 0 is {0}.
