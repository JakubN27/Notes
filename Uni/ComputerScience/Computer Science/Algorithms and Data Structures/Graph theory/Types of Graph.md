# Directed Graphs
Also knows as digraphs. In a directed graph, edges has directions.
Examples: 
- The Web graph, vertices are webpages and edges are hyperlinks, which are directional.

# Multi-graphs
In a multi-graph, you can have multiple or repeated edges between two vertices. 
Examples: 
- The air link graph, multiple flights can connect two airports.

# Pseudo-graphs
In a pseudo graph, edges of the from $uu$ called loops are allowed. Two nodes can loop between each other.

# Vertex-weighted graphs
Vertices have weights. Total cost of vertices visited needs to be considered when traversing a vertex weighted graph.

# Edge-weighted graphs
Edges have weights. Total cost of edges visited needs to be considered when traversing a edge weighted graph.
