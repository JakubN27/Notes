Vector space- a set whose elements (vectors), can be added together and multiplied ("scaled") by numbers called scalars. Operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain axioms: 

| Axiom                                                                   | Statement                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Associativity of vector addition                                        | $$u+(v+w)=(u+v)+w$$                                                                                |
| Commutativity of vector addition                                        | $$u+v=v+u$$                                                                                        |
| Identity element of vector addition                                     | There exists an element 0∈V, called the zero vector, such that v+0=v for all v∈V.                  |
| Inverse elements of vector addition                                     | For every v∈V, there exists an element −v∈V, called the additive inverse of v, such that v+(−v)=0. |
| Compatibility of scalar multiplication with field multiplication        | $$a(bv)=(ab)v$$                                                                                    |
| Identity element of scalar multiplication                               | 1v=v , where 1 denotes the multiplicative identity in F.                                           |
| Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to vector addition | $$a(u+v)=au+av$$                                                                                   |
| Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to field addition  | $$(a+b)v=av+bv$$                                                                                   |


The euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ consists of vectors such as :
$$\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ ... \\ x_n \end{pmatrix}$$
## Vector Subspaces
A subspace is a subset of a vector space that itself is also a vector space under the same operations.
